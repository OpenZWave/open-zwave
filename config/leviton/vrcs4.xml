  <!-- Scene Control -->
  <!-- Use these messages to assign scenes to the controller's buttons.
       When no scene is assigned (default behavior), the controller sends BASIC_SET messages
       to association groups 1 to 4 corresponding to the active button.
       When a scene is assigned, the controller sends scene activations and level change messages
       that offer richer control of the device's behavior.

       The controller has 8 scene groups:
         - Groups 1-4 are triggered when buttons 1-4 are pressed when their LED is not lit.
         - Groups 5-8 are triggered when buttons 1-4 are pressed when their LED is already lit.

       To configure the scenes, send SCENE_CONTROLLER_CONF_SET to associate scenes with
       each scene group.  The simplest solution is to assign scene groups 1-8 to scenes 1-8
       so they are in one-to-one correspondence using the following messages:

         2D 01 01 01 00 : Set scene group 1 to scene 1
         2D 01 02 02 00 : Set scene group 2 to scene 2
         2D 01 03 03 00 : Set scene group 3 to scene 3
         2D 01 04 04 00 : Set scene group 4 to scene 4
         2D 01 05 05 00 : Set scene group 5 to scene 5
         2D 01 06 06 00 : Set scene group 6 to scene 6
         2D 01 07 07 00 : Set scene group 7 to scene 7
         2D 01 08 08 00 : Set scene group 8 to scene 8

       Once this is done, the controller will send SCENE_ACTIVATION_SET to the devices
       in association groups 1-4 whenever their corresponding scenes are triggered.  To handle
       these messages centrally, make sure to associate the primary controller (node 1) with
       association groups 1-4.  The primary controller will then receive messages like this:

         2B 01 S# 00 : Sent by controller when scene S# is triggered

       When you press the up/down level below the scene buttons, the controller will send
       send SWITCH_MULTILEVEL_START_LEVEL_CHANGE and SWITCH_MULTILEVEL_STOP_LEVEL_CHANGE messages
       to the association group corresponding to the most recently activated scene.

         26 04 40 00 : Sent by controller when the down lever is pressed
         26 05       : Sent by controller when the down lever is released
         26 04 00 00 : Sent by controller when the up lever is pressed
         26 05       : Sent by controller when the up lever is released

       After a scene change, the controller sometimes sends SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF_GET messages
       (2C 02 00) to query the scene configuration of the controlled devices.  The controlled
       devices should reply with SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF_REPORT (2C 03 <sceneId> FF 00) to confirm
       the scene change.  Ignoring the message works too although the controller seems to ask
       several times after each scene change until it gets the expected reply.

       Scene messages interact with the indicator light change messages described above.
       Turning on and off button LEDs determines whether the controller considers the
       corresponding scenes to be active.
