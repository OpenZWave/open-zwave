Comment:
 This license text is the official license text of Brian Gladman. The
 term "is allowed without the payment of fees or royalties" shall make
 it clear that this software is now available for free (as in beer)
 and will always be. 
 The rest of the license takes care of the free as in speech.
 Nevertheless Brian permits others to distribute the software under
 other licenses. Especially he allowed me to distribute the software
 under the following conditions, which is the normal BSD license without
 mentioning fees:

 Hi Thorsten,
 .
 I am content with this and would be happy for you to replace my current
 license with is one on any files that you wish to use.
 .
 If you need a more formal agreement from me, I am sure we will be able
 to find a way of achieving this.
 .
 best regards,
 .
 Brian
