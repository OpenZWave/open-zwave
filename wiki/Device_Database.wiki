#summary Device Database is where various attributes of ZWave Devices are Stored

= Introduction =

The Device Database is where Open-ZWave retrieve details about supported devices. It Generally contains mappings between manufacture and product ID's and names, as well as specific configurations for particular devices.

Generally, a user would not need to edit/modify the device database unless they wish to add new zwave products to be supported by the library. 

Specifically, the database contains the following information:

 * Map Manufacture and Product ID's to human readable names
 * Describe Device Configuration Variables that are not exposed via the ZWave Protocol
 * Enable work-arounds for buggy or non-conforming devices.

= Details =

The database is a collection of xml files. The main file is manufacturer_specific.xml file and would be the starting point for anybody that wishes to modify the database. A sample is below:

{{{ 
<ManufacturerSpecificData xmlns='http://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/'>
        <Manufacturer id="0040" name="2B Electronics">
        </Manufacturer>
        <Manufacturer id="0098" name="2GIG Technologies">
                <Product type="1e12" id="015c" name="CT30 Thermostat" config="2gig/ct30.xml"/>
                <Product type="6401" id="0105" name="CT100 Thermostat" config="2gig/ct100.xml"/>
        </Manufacturer>
....
</ManufacturerSpecificData>
}}}
