### Issue Guidelines

Before opening a new issue, please review the following:
* The Github Issues is for OZW Bugs only. Please do not use this for general questions or howto type conversations. If you have a question, please post to our mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openzwave
* Please use the search feature to see if your issues have been raised or addressed first.
* Try the OpenZWave Log Analyzer at http://www.openzwave.com/log-analyzer if you are experiencing problems with a device on your network.
* Often we will require Log Files to help diagnose the issue. Please stop any application you are using, remove zwcfg_*.xml/ozwcache_*.xml files, and restart your application. After experiencing your issue, stop your application and attach the OZW_Log.txt file to this issue (please do not filter the log file, we often need the full log file to diagnose issues)
* If you want to add a new device to the OZW Database, please consult https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/wiki/Adding-Devices
