Version 1.1
 - Fixed Command Class Recieved Message Counter when we are handling a
   MultiInstanceMessageEncap Message (Justin)
 - Fixed Issue 310 - Unbalanced Lock/Release in Manager::IsNodeFailed and
   Manager::GetNodeQueryStage (Justin)
 - For Sleeping Devices - Do Not automatically add WakeUp Class to these
   devices if they advertise themselves as FrequentListening. This matches
   the Logic in the QueryStage functions where we skip querying the Device
   for Wakeup Configuration if its set as FLiRS. Needs some testing (Justin)
